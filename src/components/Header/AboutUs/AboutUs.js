          <p>Our application development team is from FPT University. </p>
      
          <p>In the process of studying and experiencing at the school, we realize that many students have difficulties in studying and orienting their future jobs. Mentor is someone who can answer students' problems but it is difficult to meet a mentor outside of id time. So we created this website with the purpose of creating a connection between students and mentors quickly, easily and saving time. </p>
